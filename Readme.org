* About
A Small Flutter/Dart application for android, to calculate the Lix number of a text, using a pre taken picture or the camera directly.
It is based on the image recognition from Tesseract.

* Features
The application features a main screen where you can select an image or capture a new one with the camera:
[[/images/main.png]]
When selected you are prompted to crop the image selecting only the piece of text you are interested in:
[[/images/capture.png]]
The application calculates and shows the text recognized and the LIX number of it:
[[/images/result.png]]
At this moment Danish and English Tesseract language recognition is bundled with the application.
The application uses the standard [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lix_(readability_test)][LIX]] calculation

* TODO Later
** Registration of books (Database)
A way to save books with their calculated LIX numbers to create you own library

** Better Lix Detection
Base the calculation on 3 different pages of text from the same book to get a better LIX number.
